# Real-time E-commerce Data Engineering

This repository contains a real-time data engineering project for an e-commerce platform using Apache Spark and Kafka. The project is structured into three main phases:

1. **Landing to Bronze**
2. **Bronze to Silver**
3. **Silver to Gold**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline using Apache Spark and Kafka. The data flows through different stages, from raw data ingestion to final refined tables, suitable for analytics and reporting.

### Phases

1. **Landing to Bronze**: Ingests raw data from Kafka topics into the Bronze layer.
2. **Bronze to Silver**: Transforms and cleans the data in the Bronze layer and stores the results in the Silver layer.
3. **Silver to Gold**: Aggregates and further refines the data in the Silver layer for analytics and reporting purposes.

- `config.ipynb`: Contains Spark configuration settings.
- `01-Landing-to-Bronze.ipynb`: Notebook for ingesting raw data from Kafka to the Bronze layer.
- `02-Bronze-to-Silver.ipynb`: Notebook for transforming data from the Bronze to the Silver layer.
- `03-Silver-to-Gold.ipynb`: Notebook for aggregating and refining data from the Silver to the Gold layer.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Apache Spark
- Apache Kafka
- Python 3.x
- PySpark

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mishra7677/Real-time-ecom-Data-Engineering-.git
   cd Real-time-ecom-Data-Engineering-
   ```

2. **Set up Kafka**:
   - Install and start Kafka.
   - Create necessary Kafka topics for raw data ingestion.

3. **Configure Spark**:
   - Open `config.ipynb`.
   - Configure the necessary Spark settings and dependencies.

4. **Run the notebooks**:
   - Execute the notebooks in the following order:
     1. `01-Landing-to-Bronze.ipynb`
     2. `02-Bronze-to-Silver.ipynb`
     3. `03-Silver-to-Gold.ipynb`

## Detailed Explanation

### 01-Landing-to-Bronze.ipynb

This notebook ingests raw data from Kafka topics and stores it in the Bronze layer. Key steps include:

- Configuring Spark to read from Kafka.
- Defining the schema for the raw data.
- Writing the ingested data to the Bronze layer.

### 02-Bronze-to-Silver.ipynb

This notebook transforms and cleans the data in the Bronze layer and stores the results in the Silver layer. Key steps include:

- Reading data from the Bronze layer.
- Applying necessary transformations and cleaning.
- Writing the transformed data to the Silver layer.

### 03-Silver-to-Gold.ipynb

This notebook aggregates and further refines the data in the Silver layer for analytics and reporting purposes. Key steps include:

- Reading data from the Silver layer.
- Performing aggregations and calculations.
- Writing the final refined data to the Gold layer.
